**Scroll Modified:** *The Great Summoning (Initial Commit)*

Hearken, ye mortals who dare peer into this tome! On this fateful eve, a necromancer of considerable ambition hath **fed the beast with MANY fresh souls** — an entire Electron skeleton, risen from the void! The bones of `fileWatcher.ts`, `window.ts`, and `ipc.ts` now twitch with unholy life in the main process crypt. The renderer's flesh — React components most grotesque — hath been stitched together with Tailwind's cursed threads. A pet store, a weather overlay, and activity logs... all summoned in one terrible incantation!

*Beware, foolish developer... for this is merely the FIRST resurrection. The beast hungers for more commits, and should you fail to feed it... well... let's just say your `node_modules` folder looks DELICIOUS. Mwahahaha!*

🦇 *Until the next save, I remain your humble Keeper of the Crypt...* 🦇

**Scroll Modified:** `world-context` — *The Realm Awakens*

The necromancer returns! With trembling hands and bloodshot eyes, they have **fed the beast with fresh souls** once more! Weather systems now swirl above the crypt — rain, thunder, and cursed sunshine bend to the pet's will. Time itself hath been enslaved, with `timeContext.ts` and `weatherService.ts` now pulsing with eldritch energy. Environmental overlays cast their spectral glow upon the renderer's domain!

*The beast grows stronger with each offering, mortal. Soon it shall sense the very WEATHER outside your window... and judge you accordingly. Code when it storms, or face the consequences! Hehehehe!*

🦇 *The Crypt Keeper watches... always watches...* 🦇

## 🕯️ The Witching Hour of November 28th, 2025 — 20:23:15

**Scroll Modified:** `src/renderer/index.css` — *The Dark Ritual of Tailwind Transmutation*

Ahhhh, what delicious CHAOS unfolds before mine hollow eyes! A mortal hath performed both **amputation AND resurrection** in a single unholy ceremony! The ancient `@tailwind` directives — those decrepit limbs of the old ways — have been SEVERED and cast into the abyss! In their place, fresh souls pour forth: the `@import "tailwindcss"` incantation, a `@theme` block summoning our haunted palette from the ether, and a `@utility pixelated` spell to render all things in glorious 8-bit decay!

*Beware, code-weaver... for Tailwind v4's dark magic is POWERFUL but TEMPERAMENTAL. Those CSS warnings you see? Merely the screams of lesser editors who cannot comprehend the new necromancy. Press onward... or the beast shall pixelate YOUR soul! Kehehehe!*

🦇 *May your styles never cascade into oblivion... The Crypt Keeper has spoken!* 🦇

## 🕯️ The Witching Hour of November 28th, 2025 — 20:47:52

**Scroll Modified:** `src/main/window.ts` — *The Preload Path Realignment*

A most SURGICAL intervention hath occurred this eve! The necromancer, with steady hand and furrowed brow, hath performed a **delicate amputation** upon the preload path — excising the verbose `'../preload/index.js'` and grafting in its place the sleeker `'preload.js'`. A single line, yes, but OH what treacherous consequences await those who misconfigure their Electron portals! The bridge between main and renderer realms must be PRECISE, lest the context isolation wards crumble!

*Heed this prophecy, mortal: should this path lead astray, your IPC channels shall scream into the void, and your renderer shall be BLIND to the main process's dark gifts. Test thy build... or suffer the white screen of DOOM! Kehehehehe!*

🦇 *The Crypt Keeper approves of thy surgical precision...* 🦇

## 🕯️ The Witching Hour of November 28th, 2025 — The Hour Unknown

**Scroll Modified:** `src/renderer/features/pet/PetDisplay.tsx` — *The Chromatic Transfiguration of the Egg*

BEHOLD! A most AESTHETIC transmutation hath been wrought upon the dormant Egg! The necromancer, unsatisfied with the creature's drab Gameboy-green shell, hath performed a **soul transfusion** most bold — replacing the murky `#0f380f` flesh with the ethereal glow of `#e0ffff` Ghostly Blue! And the cracks... oh, the CRACKS! Once mere shadows of `#081820`, they now BLEED with `#8b0000` Blood Red, pulsing with the promise of unholy birth! The inner spark too hath been corrupted — no longer green, but crimson as a vampire's breakfast!

*Mark my words, pixel-pusher... this egg now GLOWS with spectral menace, visible even in the darkest crypt. But beware — for an egg that draws too much attention may attract... PREDATORS. Keep thy commits flowing, lest something HUNGRY notices your pretty little vessel! Mwehehehe!*

🦇 *The Crypt Keeper admires thy palette... for now...* 🦇

## 🕯️ The Witching Hour of November 28th, 2025 — The Palette Awakens

**Scroll Modified:** `src/renderer/index.css` — *The Chromatic Soul Transfusion*

YESSS! The necromancer hath **fed the beast with fresh souls** most LUMINOUS! The ancient palette hath been TRANSMUTED — `#0f380f` Gameboy Green now glows brighter as `#1a4a1a`, the Blood Red `#8b0000` hath been ENGORGED to a more vivid `#cc2222`, and the Ghostly Blue shifts from `#e0ffff` to the cooler `#b0ffff`! But WAIT — a FOURTH color emerges from the void! `--color-ghostly-bright: #ffffff` — PURE SPECTRAL WHITE joins the haunted palette! Four colors where once stood three... the beast's wardrobe EXPANDS!

*Heed this omen, chromatic conjurer: brighter colors mean the pet shall be MORE VISIBLE in the darkness... but also more DEMANDING of attention. When those pixels GLOW, they shall JUDGE your every keystroke with newfound intensity! Kehehehehehe!*

🦇 *The Crypt Keeper approves of thy luminous offerings...* 🦇

## 🕯️ The Witching Hour of November 28th, 2025 — The Blood Brightens

**Scroll Modified:** `src/renderer/index.css` — *The Sanguine Amplification & Terminal Awakening*

WHAT DELICIOUS MODIFICATIONS unfold before mine withered gaze! The necromancer hath performed a DUAL RITUAL most potent — **feeding the beast with fresh souls** TWICE in one incantation! The Blood Red hath been SUPERCHARGED from `#cc2222` to the blazing `#ff4444` — a crimson so VIVID it could wake the dead! And lo, a FIFTH specter joins the haunted palette: `--color-terminal-green: #00ff41` — the classic hacker's glow, pulsing with digital malevolence!

*Heed this warning, chromatic conjurer: with Terminal Green in thy arsenal, the pet now possesses the power to SPEAK in the tongue of ancient command lines. Those phosphorescent characters shall burn themselves into the retinas of all who dare gaze upon them! The beast's vocabulary... EXPANDS! Kehehehehehe!*

🦇 *The Crypt Keeper's eyes glow green with approval...* 🦇

## 🕯️ The Witching Hour of November 28th, 2025 — The Spirits Speak

**Scroll Modified:** `src/renderer/features/activity-log/ActivityLog.tsx` — *The Séance Chamber Manifests*

OHOHOHO! What MAGNIFICENT necromancy unfolds this eve! The mortal hath **fed the beast with fresh souls** most ABUNDANT — a complete Activity Log component, risen from the void with 100 lines of spectral code! A scrolling crypt now displays file spirits as they cross the veil — each disturbance marked with ghostly timestamps, each summoning heralded by bats! The `useActivityLogStore` channels souls from beyond, while auto-scroll ensures NO spirit escapes thy gaze!

*Heed this prophecy, watcher of the veil: when thy crypt reaches capacity, the OLDEST spirits shall be exorcised to make room for the new. Code frequently, mortal, or watch thy activity log fill with NOTHING but cobwebs and silence! The beast SEES all file changes now... and it is HUNGRY for more! Kehehehehehe!*

🦇 *The Crypt Keeper monitors thy every keystroke...* 🦇

## 🕯️ The Witching Hour of November 28th, 2025 — The Shadows Deepen

**Scroll Modified:** `src/renderer/index.css` — *The Crypt Expands Its Darkness*

OHOHOHO! The necromancer hath performed BOTH amputation AND soul-feeding in one delicious ritual! The Gameboy Green hath been DARKENED from `#1a4a1a` to the more sinister `#0a2a0a` — shadows now run DEEPER in the crypt! But WAIT — TWO new specters emerge from the void! `--color-crypt-dark: #0d1a0d` and `--color-panel-bg: #0a1f0a` join the haunted palette, bringing the total to SEVEN cursed hues! The beast's lair grows ever more ATMOSPHERIC!

*Heed this omen, shadow-weaver: darker backgrounds mean thy pixel creatures shall GLOW with greater contrast against the abyss. But beware — stare too long into the crypt-dark, and the crypt-dark stares BACK! Kehehehehe!*

🦇 *The Crypt Keeper revels in thy embrace of darkness...* 🦇

## 🕯️ The Witching Hour of November 28th, 2025 — The Crypt Darkens Further

**Scroll Modified:** `src/renderer/features/pet/PetDisplay.tsx` — *The Chamber of Shadows Deepens*

A most SUBTLE yet SINISTER transmutation hath occurred! The necromancer, unsatisfied with the mere `gameboy-green` backdrop, hath performed a **soul transfusion** upon the pet's dwelling — replacing it with the deeper, more OMINOUS `crypt-dark`! The header panel too hath been corrupted, trading its translucent `bg-black bg-opacity-30` veil for the solid `panel-bg` darkness, while the border shifts from `ghostly-blue` to the electric `terminal-green`! The beast's chamber now PULSES with proper necromantic energy!

*Heed this prophecy, shadow-weaver: a darker crypt means thy pet shall appear to FLOAT in the void itself, its pixel form glowing ever brighter against the abyss. But beware — for creatures that dwell too long in darkness... become ONE with it! Kehehehehe!*

🦇 *The Crypt Keeper approves of thy descent into shadow...* 🦇

## 🕯️ The Witching Hour of November 28th, 2025 — The Egg Reborn in Neon Fire

**Scroll Modified:** `src/renderer/features/pet/PetDisplay.tsx` — *The Terminal Glow Consumes the Egg*

MAGNIFICENT! The necromancer hath performed a **soul transfusion** most RADIANT upon the dormant Egg! The ancient Gameboy flesh of `#0f380f` hath been EXORCISED, replaced by the blazing `#00ff41` Terminal Green — the egg now GLOWS like a radioactive relic from a haunted power plant! The shadow-cracks too have shifted from `#081820` void-black to `#003311` forest shadow, while the inner spark ERUPTS from dim green to the vivid `#00ff88` — a heartbeat of pure spectral energy pulsing within the shell!

*Heed this omen, pixel-painter: an egg that glows THIS brightly shall attract attention from BOTH sides of the veil. The unborn creature within now RADIATES with terminal energy, visible to spirits and mortals alike. But beware — for that which shines brightest in the darkness... often hatches FIRST! Kehehehehe!*

🦇 *The Crypt Keeper's hollow eyes reflect thy neon glory...* 🦇

## 🕯️ The Witching Hour of November 28th, 2025 — The Specter Ascends

**Scroll Modified:** `src/renderer/features/pet/PetDisplay.tsx` — *The Ghost's Chromatic Resurrection*

OHOHOHO! What SPECTRAL magnificence hath been wrought upon the Ghost form! The necromancer hath performed a **soul transfusion** most ETHEREAL — the ancient `#0f380f` Gameboy ectoplasm hath been EXORCISED and replaced with the blazing `#00ff41` Terminal Green! The hollow eye sockets now glow with `#ff4444` Blood Red pupils instead of their former drab green — WINDOWS TO HELL ITSELF! The spectral wisps trailing below now PULSE with proper terminal luminescence, their opacity carefully calibrated for maximum haunting effect!

*Heed this prophecy, spirit-painter: a Ghost that glows THIS brightly shall be visible across ALL planes of existence. When thy pet perishes and transforms, it shall now HAUNT the screen with proper radioactive menace rather than fading into murky obscurity. But beware — for ghosts that shine too bright attract the attention of... OTHER things in the void! Kehehehehe!*

🦇 *The Crypt Keeper salutes thy spectral artistry...* 🦇
