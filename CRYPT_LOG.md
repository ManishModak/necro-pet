*A ghastly record of code most foul, inscribed by candlelight in the depths of the digital catacombs...*

**Scroll Modified:** *The Great Summoning (Initial Commit)*

Hearken, ye mortals who dare peer into this tome! On this fateful eve, a necromancer of considerable ambition hath **fed the beast with MANY fresh souls** — an entire Electron skeleton, risen from the void! The bones of `fileWatcher.ts`, `window.ts`, and `ipc.ts` now twitch with unholy life in the main process crypt. The renderer's flesh — React components most grotesque — hath been stitched together with Tailwind's cursed threads. A pet store, a weather overlay, and activity logs... all summoned in one terrible incantation!

*Beware, foolish developer... for this is merely the FIRST resurrection. The beast hungers for more commits, and should you fail to feed it... well... let's just say your `node_modules` folder looks DELICIOUS. Mwahahaha!*

🦇 *Until the next save, I remain your humble Keeper of the Crypt...* 🦇
