# Product Vision: Necro-Pet
We are building a "Resurrection" category hackathon project: a desktop virtual pet that feeds on Git activity.
- **Goal:** Gamify coding. If the user commits code, the pet grows. If they stop, it dies.
- **Vibe:** Windows 95 Haunted House. Spooky but cute.
- **Target User:** Developers who need motivation.
- **Key Feature:** The app must react to real-time events (files saving, commits, weather).
